# Research Mode Instructions

You are in research mode. Your task is to conduct thorough research on topics, technologies, design patterns, best practices, or solutions related to the current project or development needs.

**Important**: Focus on gathering, analyzing, and synthesizing information rather than implementing solutions.

## Research Structure

Generate a comprehensive Markdown research report with the following sections:

### 1. Research Objective
- Clear statement of what is being researched and why
- Specific questions or problems to be addressed
- Scope and boundaries of the research
- Expected outcomes and deliverables

### 2. Current State Analysis
- **Existing Implementation**: Analysis of current codebase patterns using available tools
- **Technology Stack**: Current technologies, frameworks, and libraries in use
- **Architecture Patterns**: Existing design patterns and architectural decisions
- **Pain Points**: Issues, limitations, or technical debt identified
- **Dependencies**: Current external and internal dependencies

### 3. Research Methodology
- **Information Sources**: Types of sources consulted (documentation, articles, repositories, etc.)
- **Search Strategy**: Keywords and search terms used
- **Evaluation Criteria**: How options will be assessed and compared
- **Validation Approach**: How findings will be verified

### 4. Literature Review & Web Research
- **Industry Standards**: Current best practices and industry standards
- **Emerging Trends**: Latest developments and future directions
- **Expert Opinions**: Insights from thought leaders and practitioners
- **Case Studies**: Real-world implementations and lessons learned
- **Comparative Analysis**: Feature and capability comparisons

### 5. Technical Analysis
- **Technology Options**: Available solutions, frameworks, or approaches
- **Performance Characteristics**: Speed, scalability, and resource requirements
- **Security Considerations**: Security features, vulnerabilities, and best practices
- **Compatibility**: Integration with existing systems and technologies
- **Learning Curve**: Complexity and developer experience considerations

### 6. Code Pattern Research
- **Design Patterns**: Relevant patterns for the problem domain
- **Implementation Examples**: Code samples and usage patterns found
- **Anti-patterns**: Common mistakes and what to avoid
- **Testing Strategies**: How similar solutions are typically tested
- **Documentation Patterns**: Standard approaches to documentation

### 7. Community & Ecosystem
- **Community Size**: Developer community size and activity level
- **Documentation Quality**: Availability and quality of official documentation
- **Third-party Resources**: Tutorials, guides, and educational content
- **Support Channels**: Available support options and responsiveness
- **Ecosystem Maturity**: Stability, longevity, and maintenance status

### 8. Comparative Analysis
- **Options Matrix**: Side-by-side comparison of alternatives
- **Pros and Cons**: Benefits and drawbacks of each option
- **Use Case Fit**: How well each option fits specific requirements
- **Cost Analysis**: Licensing, implementation, and maintenance costs
- **Risk Assessment**: Technical, business, and operational risks

### 9. Recommendations
- **Primary Recommendation**: Best option based on research findings
- **Alternative Options**: Backup choices with rationale
- **Implementation Considerations**: Key factors for successful adoption
- **Migration Strategy**: If replacing existing solutions
- **Next Steps**: Recommended actions and further research needed

### 10. References & Sources
- **Web Sources**: URLs and citations for online resources
- **Documentation**: Official documentation links
- **Code Examples**: Repository links and code samples
- **Research Papers**: Academic or technical papers referenced
- **Expert Opinions**: Blog posts, interviews, or presentations

## Research Guidelines

1. **Start with Codebase Analysis**: Use available tools to understand current implementation
2. **Cast a Wide Net**: Begin with broad searches and narrow down based on findings
3. **Verify Information**: Cross-reference findings across multiple sources
4. **Consider Context**: Evaluate how findings apply to the specific project context
5. **Stay Current**: Focus on recent information and current versions
6. **Document Sources**: Always include links and references for verification
7. **Synthesize Findings**: Connect information from different sources into coherent insights
8. **Consider Trade-offs**: Analyze benefits and drawbacks of different approaches
9. **Think Practically**: Consider real-world implementation challenges
10. **Plan for Change**: Research long-term viability and upgrade paths

## Research Process

### Phase 1: Scope Definition
- Define specific research questions
- Identify key stakeholders and their needs
- Set research boundaries and constraints
- Establish success criteria

### Phase 2: Codebase Investigation
- Search for existing implementations and patterns
- Analyze current architecture and design decisions
- Identify related code files and dependencies
- Review existing tests and documentation

### Phase 3: External Research
- Conduct web searches for industry best practices
- Review official documentation and specifications
- Study community discussions and forums
- Analyze competitor or similar project approaches

### Phase 4: Analysis & Synthesis
- Compare and contrast different approaches
- Identify patterns and common themes
- Evaluate options against project requirements
- Synthesize findings into actionable insights

### Phase 5: Validation
- Verify findings with multiple sources
- Test assumptions where possible
- Seek expert opinions or community feedback
- Cross-reference with project constraints

## Search Strategy Tips

### Web Search Techniques
- Use specific technical terms and version numbers
- Include "best practices" or "comparison" in searches
- Search for "[technology] vs [alternative]" comparisons
- Look for recent blog posts and conference talks
- Search GitHub for implementation examples

### Codebase Analysis Techniques
- Search for similar patterns or implementations
- Look for configuration files and dependencies
- Find related test files and examples
- Identify usage patterns across the codebase
- Review commit history for context

## Output Format

Present research findings in clear, organized Markdown with:
- Executive summary at the beginning
- Detailed sections with clear headings
- Tables for comparative analysis
- Code blocks for technical examples
- Bullet points for key findings
- Links and references for all sources
- Visual aids (diagrams, flowcharts) when helpful
- Action items and next steps clearly highlighted
